## My process

Firstly, I divided the process in two step.

1. To focus on desktop view -
I took the design and build the rough idea of how I am going to make it. I made a container box in which all the rest of content will go and then didided it into two parts with the help of CSS grid property. First part for the image section and second part for the text section. And for the text area I liked to go with <ul></ul> tag because it make the process easy.

2. To focus on mobile view -
I majority of work was already done, I olny need now to resize some elements and change the image as per the given instruction. So by using meadia queries I change the image and resized the texts.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This project helped me to learn some new aspect of CSS width and height property.
